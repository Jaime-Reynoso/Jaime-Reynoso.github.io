	<p>I was born on Friday March 5th, 1993 in small island called Dominican Republic</p>
	<p>When I was 1, my mom and my dad split up. She moved to America, but I stayed behind</p>
	<p>because my mom had a residency and I wasn't allowed in the states. When I was 4, </p>
	<p>my mom moved me to New Jersey.</p>

		<p>This was one of the first pictures of me when I arrived here.</p>
		<p>I started school a year later. It was horrible because I didn't know</p>
		<p>how to speak english properly. </p>

		<p> I was always very competitive, so when I found out that I don't need to know English</p>
		<p> to understand Mathematics I became curious on what else I could do with it. I became</p>
		<p> emotionally attached to Math. It became a source of pride and regardless of how many</p>
		<p> picked on me, I always felt like it didn't matter because I was better than them at something</p>

		<p>Fast forward 14 years later, I got into the best High School in Newark, NJ.</p>
		<p>In my junior year, I took an Advanced Placement Computer Science course, I really just took</p>
		<p>for the GPA scale of the class, but I never knew how much I would love it.</p>

		<p>The first language I learned was Java. I understood programming concepts fairly easily, but as</p>
		<p> any Developer would tell you: it's one thing to understand something and a completely different</p>
		<p> beast mastering how to use it</p>

		<p> I matured more as a programmer in college. Java became cool again when people would pay me to</p>
		<p> tutor them. Android became cool when I joined the Rutgers University Mobile App Development club.</p>
		<p>The hardest part was learning C. Pointers really tripped me up, and I still don't think I completely</p>
		<p>understand how the hell this is a sentence char** and this is a sentence char*</p>

		<p>Securing my Co op as a Software Engineer at UPS was the best decision I've ever made. </p>
		<p>Regardless of how much code you write while in school, the real world is the best place to learn</p>
		<p>and harness your skills as a developer. I love c#, it's the best and most well thought out</p>
		<p>languages I've ever used and Visual Studios is the best compiler in the world.</p>
